Weather Anaylsis:

Based upon the trend lines for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere, we can see the following weather conditions:

1) Temperature:
   Temperature increases moving towards 0 degrees latitude or towards the equator.  Most of the highest temperatures througout the years occur along the
   equator.  Temperature steadily decreases closer towards the polar regions.  In the Temperature plots for both Northern and Southern Hemispheres, we see
   the temperature trend lines sloping towards zero (0), indicative of moving closer towards zero degrees latitude (aka: The Equator).
  
2) Humidity:
   Observing the trend lines for Humidity, we can see that both Humidity plots for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have a horizontal slope and indicate
   no correlation or trends.  We can conclude that humidity fluctuates regardless of latitude.
  
3) Cloudiness:
   Trend lines for cloudiness in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have no correlation to latitude.  We can see that cloudiness occurs in varying
   percentages regardless of latitude.
  
4) Wind Speed:
   The plots for wind speed for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere show that latitude have no correlation to wind speed.  However, we can see that wind
   speed seem to be a higher nearer 0 degrees latitude, which would make sense since the equator receives more sunlight than other parts of the world.
   Increased sunlight can generate more winds in the equitorial regions, where the genesis of many Pacific and Atlantic weather instability (i.e. storms)
   comes from.  It would be better to pull weather data from the equitorial regions to validate this.
  
5) Addendum:
   Comparing the City plots and the plots from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, we can see that they look very similiar.  Again, the data shows
   that there is little correlation between latitude with humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.  However, latitude and temperature does have a correlation,
   in which we can see in the City plots and the Northern and Southern Hemisphere plots.
